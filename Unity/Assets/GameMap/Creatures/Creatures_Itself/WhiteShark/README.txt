Thanks for purchasing this model!



(Differences between the variants)

The differences between the variants are the diffuse,roughness and normal maps .

AO maps are the same megalodon variants and the wshark variant have an own ao map that is located in the same file .


(About the blend file)

Theres 3 rigs Control rig , export rig and lods rig (the export rig and lods have the same function)

The rig is simple is just based on copy transforms , except that i add a master bone that allows that "spin" effect without affecting other bones (is the cube in the middle)
and i separated the most important bones and give it shapes , you can still animate the other bones that are in a second layer but they dont really need to be moved, 
also the animations with the constraints are still included in the control rig if you want to modify it in some way ,if you want to do your own animations 
Use the control rig to do it , and when you finish bake all the animations into the export rig , and that should be it , delete the constraints
at the end so theres no weird movement tho.

(MULTIRES)

is only available on the model with the control rig and have a max of 4 subdivisions ,is a reshape of the hp version that is in the highpoly collection , delete the hps if
you find it useless , if you already have a scene and you want to add the whale in it just select the armature with the model and copy paste into your project.

Also i noticed when import the 4k txt in blender EEVEE the txtures look with bad quality , so i learn a way to fix it if you dont know yet, you can go to Edit->
Preferences->Viewport->Textures and where it says limit size put it to off and thats it it should look way better now.

Theres some random things i add to render it for myself like the water and the sun rays , maybe you can find it usefull, idk if the textures that i used in the blend file
comes too in the blend file you have now so maybe its all pink , anyways you can delete those if you want
it will not affect anything.


And thats all if you have any error when using this model contact me so i see what i can do.


Also dont forget to clear the constraints of the rig at the end when you export it , so theres no weird movement in the animations ...
